In the Farm Central business, employee, farmer, and product data are managed through the Farm Central MVC Application, a web-based system. It offers a user-friendly interface that enables users to do a number of operations relating to staff management, farmer management, and product management.

This application's goal is to manage staff information, farmer information, and product inventory more efficiently. It makes it possible to collect, organize, and retrieve data about workers, farms, and goods efficiently, which improves organizational productivity and decision-making in general.

The Farm Central MVC Application is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which separates the application logic into three interconnected components: the model (data and business logic), the view (user interface), and the controller (handles user input and coordinates interactions between the model and the view).

The application utilizes a database management system, such as SQL Server, to store and retrieve data related to employees, farmers, and products. It leverages ASP.NET MVC framework for developing the web-based user interface, allowing users to interact with the application through a browser.
